Rules of rummy 
Dealer gives one card at a time face down, beginning with the player on the left. When two people play, each person gets 10 cards. When three or four people play, each receives seven cards; when five or six play, each receives six cards. The remaining cards are placed face down on the table, forming the stock.
The top card of the stock is turned face up and becomes the upcard. It is placed next to the stock to start the discard pile.
Each turn, the player must start by taking a card from the stock, or taking multiple cards from the discard pile. You can take any card from the discard pile, but you must also take every card on top of the card you choose.
After picking up a card, the player can play as many melds as they can. (matched sets consisting of groups of three or four of a kind, or sequences of three or more cards of the same suit)
In addition to playing melds the player may add one or more cards from their hand to any matched set already shown on the table. Thus, if threes are showing, they may add the fourth three; if the 8, 9, and 10 of clubs are showing, they may add J, or Q, J, 7, or 7, 6.
Finally, each turn must end by discarding a card.
When a player gets rid of all of their cards, they end the game. The winner is determined by the total value of all played cards, minus the value of all cards in their hand.
Players can choose to continue the game with a running tally.
